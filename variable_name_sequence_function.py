"""
A simple function that converts a variable star name to a sequential number.

Variable star names are created per the following specification:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_star_designation

"Variable stars are designated using a variation on the Bayer 
designation format of an identifying label (as described below) 
combined with the Latin genitive of the name of the constellation 
in which the star lies. 

The current naming system is:

* Stars with existing Greek letter Bayer designations are not 
  given new designations.
* Otherwise, start with the letter R and go through Z.
* Continue with RR...RZ, then use SS...SZ, TT...TZ and so on 
  until ZZ.
* Use AA...AZ, BB...BZ, CC...CZ and so on until reaching QZ, 
  omitting J in both the first and second positions.
* Abandon the Latin script after 334 combinations of letters and 
  start naming stars with V335, V336, and so on.

The second letter is never nearer the beginning of the alphabet than the first, e.g., no star can be BA, CA, CB, DA and so on.

Examples are R Coronae Borealis, YZ Ceti, V603 Aquilae.
